# YOU WILL NOT BE PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR THIS RELEASE

# QBUS x OSM | SVRP INSPIRED HUD for QBUS-FW 
SVRP Server Inspired HuD for QBUS Servers. I tried my level best to fix it, add all mechanics like thirst, hunger, stress, etc. I with my testers have tested the LOOPS and FUNCTIONS work the way they should. Still Don't expect it to run absolutely flawlessly. Still better than ones that get Leaked Everyday.
